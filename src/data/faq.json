    "question": "Why don’t you take e-transfer personally?",
    "answer": "I’ve had a couple instances already where clients were shown my real name after the e-transfer which later resulted in bad experiences, especially as I’m new to Canada. This is also why I’m strict with deposits for new clients."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you get tested often to assure my safety?",
    "answer": "Yes, I get tested weekly and see very limited clients. I can show you a hard copy of my updated tests in person if needed as well."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you see virgins?",
    "answer": "Yes, I’m very communicative so no worries if you’re shy!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you offer DOM services?",
    "answer": "I have all the equipment and not to mention I'm Russian which automatically makes me the best type of gal for the service as we’re very dominant people, but also loving if that’s not your thing."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you see couples?",
    "answer": "Yes, I’m bisexual so I like to experience the best of both worlds."
  },
  {
    "question": "I have a specific request/need; are you able to accommodate me?",
    "answer": "I welcome a diverse array of individuals, however I will always make sure I’m able to provide the experience you are looking for before going forward with a booking. If you have any special needs or requests, feel free to express them to me in your inquiry, and I will do my best to accommodate you."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I see you again?",
    "answer": "In order to create the most authentic experience possible, I am choosing to cultivate a select group of clients that best align with the type of service I want to offer. I do not discriminate based on age, race, religion, ability, or creed, however I do reserve the right to refuse service if I feel we are not compatible long-term."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do You Accept References Instead?",
    "answer": "NO. There is absolutely NO way to bypass the deposit. The reference system is something many ladies use but as I appreciate them, not everyone has the same experiences, preferences, or expectations."
